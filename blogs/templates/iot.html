<h2 class="what">What is IoT?</h2>
<p class="ans">IoT, or Internet of Things, is a network of physical 
    objects, devices, and machines that are embedded <br>
    with sensors, software, and connectivity to collect and 
    exchange data. This data can be used to automate <br>
    processes, improve efficiency, and provide insights into 
    how systems are operating, resulting in increased <br>
    productivity, cost savings, and improved decision-making.</p>
<h2 class="how">How to learn IoT?</h2>
<ol class="lt">
    <li>Start with electronics, 
        networking, and 
        programming 
        fundamentals to 
        understand the 
        underlying technologies 
        powering IoT devices.
    </li>
    <li>Choose an IoT platform 
        or development board 
        like Arduino, Raspberry 
        Pi, or NodeMCU for 
        hands-on experience.
    </li>
    <li>Explore sensors and 
        actuators to collect data 
        and control physical 
        devices. Common sensors 
        include temperature, 
        humidity, and motion 
        sensors.
    </li>
    <li>Develop IoT applications, 
        starting with simple 
        projects like smart home 
        devices, or complex 
        systems such as industrial 
        automation solutions
    </li>
    <li>Join communities to 
        connect with peers, 
        ask questions, share 
        projects, learn from 
        others in the field, & 
        stay up-to-date on 
        new developments.
    </li>
</ol>
