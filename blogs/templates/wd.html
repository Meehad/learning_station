<h2 class="what">What is Web Development?</h2>
<p class="ans">Web development is the process of building and 
    maintaining websites and web applications that run on the 
    internet. It encompasses a wide range of tasks, such as<br> 
    designing user interfaces, developing the back-end logic, 
    integrating databases and third-party services, and <br>
    testing the system. Web development requires knowledge 
    of programming languages, frameworks, and tools such as <br>
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby on Rails, and more. 
    Successful web development projects rely on effective <br>
    project management, collaboration, and an understanding 
    of user experience and web design principles.</p>
