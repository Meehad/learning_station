<h2 class="what">What is Flutter?</h2>
<p class="ans">Flutter is a mobile app development framework 
    created by Google. It allows developers to build high-performance, visually attractive, and natively compiled 
    applications for multiple platforms using a single 
    codebase.
    Flutter uses Dart programming language, which 
    provides a modern, easy-to-learn syntax, and features 
    a wide range of customizable widgets, tools, and 
    libraries, making it ideal for building complex UI designs 
    and animations. 
    Flutter is a popular choice for creating cross-platform 
    apps for iOS, Android, and web.</p>
