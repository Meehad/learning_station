<h2 class="what">What is Mobile App Development?</h2>
<p class="ans">Mobile app development is the process of creating software 
    for smartphones, tablets, and digital assistants, most commonly for the Android and iOS operating systems. <br>
    The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store, or accessed through a mobile web browser. 
    The programming and markup languages used for this kind of software development include Java, Swift, C#, and HTML5. <br> 
    Mobile app development can be broad or specific, referring to the coding and deployment of the app.
    The process involves creating installable software bundles, <br>
    enabling backend services for data access through APIs, and testing the application on target devices.</p>
