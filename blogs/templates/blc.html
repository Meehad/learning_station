<h2 class="what">What is Blockchain?</h2>
<p class="ans">
    Blockchain is a secure digital ledger that uses 
cryptography to record transactions in a decentralised 
and transparent way. It enables peer-to-peer <br> 
transactions without intermediaries and has 
applications in various industries, including finance 
and supply chain management. It also enables <br>
decentralised applications and smart contracts.
