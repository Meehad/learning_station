<h2 class="what">What is DevOps?</h2>
<p class="ans">DevOps is a software development methodology that 
    emphasises collaboration, communication, and 
    automation between software developers and IT 
    operations professionals. It involves integrating 
    development and operations teams to streamline the 
    software development process, improve quality, and 
    reduce time to market. DevOps aims to increase the 
    frequency and speed of software releases while 
    maintaining the stability and reliability of the systems. 
    It involves using tools and processes that automate the 
    build, test, and deployment of software applications. 
    The DevOps approach also focuses on continuous 
    improvement and feedback to ensure that the 
    software meets the evolving needs of the business and 
    customers.</p>
