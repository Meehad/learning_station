<h2 class="what">What is AI/ML?</h2>
<p class="ans">
    AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to the development of 
intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human-level intelligence. ML (Machine Learning) is a subfield of AI that focuses on developing <br>
algorithms and statistical models that enable 
machines to learn from and make predictions or <br>
decisions based on data. This is done by providing 
machines with training data and allowing them to <br>
learn from that data without being explicitly 
programmed. ML is used in a wide range of <br>
applications, including image and speech recognition, 
natural language processing, recommendation <br>
systems, and predictive analytics.

<h2 class="how">How to learn AI and ML?</h2>
<ol class="lt">
    <li>Start with the basics 
        of programming, 
        statistics, and linear 
        algebra.
    </li>
    <li>Learn the fundamentals of AI/ML and the different 
        types of algorithms.
    </li>
    <li>Practice with small 
        projects and gradually 
        increase the complexity.
    </li>
    <li>Join groups or forums to 
        interact with others in the 
        industry, ask questions,<br> 
        share projects, get advice 
        from experts, and keep up 
        with the latest news.
    </li>
