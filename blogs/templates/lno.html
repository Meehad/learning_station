<h2 class="what">What is No/Low Code?</h2>
<p class="ans">No/Low code platforms and tools enable non-technical 
    users to create applications and software solutions with <br> 
    pre-built components, visual interfaces, and drag-and-drop functionalities, without the need for extensive 
    programming knowledge or experience. This approach
    accelerates development, reduces costs, and empowers <br> 
    citizen developers and business users to create custom 
    solutions.</p>
